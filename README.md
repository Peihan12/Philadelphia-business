RQ: What is the movement of businesses before and after covid?

The figures below are showing the food-related business (simply called restaurants) opening and closing status distributions in Philadelphia.

Black points are representing the CBDs areas and the blue ones represent the other areas (suburb ring).

It's intuitively showing that the number of the opening of new restaurants in the suburb ring has increased more than the that in the CBD areas.

Comparatively, restaurants closed more in CBD than in other areas.

Based on the initial description analysis, my finding is that the businesses around neighbors are moving towards suburbs from CBD.

I will do more tests for other retail industries and do more statistical test.

It agrees with the conclusions of other literature
